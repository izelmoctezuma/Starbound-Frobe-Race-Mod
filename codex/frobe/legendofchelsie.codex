		"Chelsie. Not a name like most other Felin have. Even when born and raised on other worlds, Felin tend to retain Felin names.

Chelsie has never been like other Felin. She was born near an Apex settlement on a distant planet, to a pair of scholars, the first Felin to travel at nonrelativistic speeds. When she was young, her parents died, not having any hunters nearby to defend them.",

		"Chelsie grew up to be a fearsome hunter, teaching herself in the ways of the Paths without knowing of them. Her free-spirited mind brought variations on the Paths that hadn't been conceived of for ages.

In the end, the Apex settlement, a laboratory, was razed to the ground and she had left the planet in a supply craft.",

		"She was still unnamed when she met a group of humans on her travels, and they called her 'Chelsie', for she reminded them of the big cats of Earth and humans like their alliteration.

She was indeed as brutal and cunning as she was beautiful. When she returned to Firrhna as a young adult in her stolen Apex craft, her exploits had already preceded her by far."
