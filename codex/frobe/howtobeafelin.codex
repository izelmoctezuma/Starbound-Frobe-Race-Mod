		"There are basically four paths a Felin may take; the Path of the Hunter, the Path of the Crafter, the Path of the Comforter, and the Path of the Scholar.",

		"The Path of the Hunter involves going places, leaving home. It involves exploration, meeting other people, of other species. Importantly it means finding and killing prey for food and materials, as well as plants and lifeless things that someone might need.",

		"The Path of the Crafter involves creation, in its multitude of senses. Architects, builders, weavers -- all Craft, and enrich themselves and the world with their creations. They work together with the Hunters to collect raw material.",

		"The Path of the Comforter involves comfort, again in several senses. They are healers, consorts, psychiatrists, and others like that. If someone is hurt in any way, requires peace of mind, or is simply lonely, the Comforters are there.",

		"The Path of the Scholar involves all things of Deeper Knowledge. Any Felin can be expected to be able to read and write, but only in the Common Scripts. It's the Scholars you could expect to still know the Symbolspeak in this day and age.",

		"A single Felin is not in any way limited to following a single Path. As is their nature, they may jump from one Path to another and profit from all. A Hunter may also be a Crafter, or a Comforter. A Hunter who goes off-world is probably also a Scholar. A Comforter may be a Crafter, and any other combination is possible.",

		"A Hunter knows where to strike her opponent for best effect. A Scholar knows -why-. Fear the Hunter-Scholar, for she has the drive and skill as well as the knowledge."
