		"Councilman Laenathin visited the University one day, for he was of a curious mood. Finding a scholar who did not seem otherwise occupied, he asked \"what happens when I die, scholar?\"

\"That depends, my lord, on which sense you mean,\" said the scholar. \"In the biological sense, your lifeless body would wither away, its constituent parts breaking down, and the tiniest bits slowly disperse. In time, these bits would reform into various other expressions.\"",
		"\"And what of the me who is Laenathin?\" asked the lord, nodding in acceptance of the answer so far.

\"I fear to say, but the he who is Laenathin would cease to be long before his body does.\"",
		"To the scholar's relief, the lord did not seem to take offense. \"Then what is death like?\" he asked instead.

\"Null, my lord, for there would be no he who is Laenathin to experience the state of death.\"

At that moment, Lord Laenathin finally understood what the scholars meant with that infuriating word \"null\"."
