		"Among the Felin, there are those who are pinnacles in their art, whose example all Felin are highly suggested to follow.

Felin may have no Gods, but they certainly have their Heroes.",

		"To become the Hero of a particular art, one must be recognized as the best there is at what that art entails.",

		"One popular example is The Hunter, Chelsie. Her name is not like most other Felin, for she was born off-world and contaminated by the local culture in a way that helped increase her hunting prowess to incredible heights. Her strategic skill is likewise commendable, and she is as wise as she is beautiful.",

		"Another well-known Hero is The Healer, Letrune. Though not a real doctor, she had played on on stage often enough, and excelled in the healing arts when a co-star got wounded in an accident. Her caring deeds continue to inspire comforters around the entire span of the Felin species' influence. She is said to have a bottomless love for other beings who require her care and attention.",

		"Preceding them both in chronology and scale of deeds is the Leader, Councilman Laenathin. A leonid of noble stock, and one of very few Felin with a full beard as glorious as his leadership. He was a highly learned scholar as well as a warrior, and responsible for most significant developments of Felin culture and expansion, such as ushering in the space age, until his untimely death."
